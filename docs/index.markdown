Professionally, I work as a **software engineer**, but I'm also an author, (aspiring) artist and photographer, eager traveler, occasional content creator, fashion enthusiast, tech volunteer, fangirl, ... (the list goes on).

Passionate, self-driven, and interested in a crazy amount of things (people around me can confirm that!), I aspire to be a Renaissance Woman (a.k.a. polymath).

## Updates
* 2023: I'll be an industry instructor for Machine Learning and Soft Skills in [Bangkit 2023](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/?tab=machine-learning) again!
