(she/her)

Professionally, I work as a software engineer at Google, but I'm also an author, photographer, eager traveler, occasional content creator, fashion enthusiast, tech volunteer, ... (the list goes on).

Passionate, self-driven, and interested in a crazy amount of things (my family, friends, and co-workers can confirm that!), I aspire to be a Renaissance Woman (a.k.a. polymath), although I'm also a member of *kaum rebahan*.

**kaum rebahan*: (Indonesian slang) a person who enjoys lying down for a great portion of their day.

## Updates
* 2023: I'll be an industry instructor for Machine Learning and Soft Skills in [Bangkit 2023](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/?tab=machine-learning) again!
* 2022: Got promoted at work, started a social group in the office, hosted STEP interns, and traveled to almost 50 cities.
* 2021: Volunteered for Bangkit for the first time. Finished my 2nd long novel, [Embracing Dawn](https://www.wattpad.com/story/254253425-embracing-dawn-v-%E2%9C%93) (co-authored with [TheEod](https://www.wattpad.com/user/TheEod)), which was nominated for The Wattys 2021 (Indonesian edition).
* 2020: Started Active English Club since I was bored during lockdown. Became a note taker in the 2020 Grace Hopper Celebration.
* 2019: Started working at Google and published my first novel, Jakarta Vigilante (in Bahasa Indonesia).

## TMI
* I'm an ENTP 3w4 and Choleric/Phlegmatic.
* 3 things I need to do: eat, sleep, work.
* I wrote stories since I was 5 years old. Unfortunately, I don't have any work prior to my teens (they were cringy anyway!).
* I wanted to major in English Literature but my parents thought it was better for me to major in Computer Science. (They were right!)
* I love fantasy and any kinds of mythology although Greek is my kinda expertise.
* I'm a huge fan of J. R. R. Tolkien and The Lord of the Rings books. My favorite novel of all times is The Silmarillion.
* Other favorite books: Anne of Green Gables (L. M. Montgomery), Little Women (Louisa May Alcott), Pride and Prejudice (Jane Austen).
* I've visited Tolkien's grave in Oxford, Jane Austen's grave in Winchester, and Shakespeare's grave in Stratford-upon-Avon.
